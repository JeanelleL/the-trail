# Balloon Point Marker GPS System

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):**
**Currently have 2 members but would love to have more:) Jeanelle Lin, Juan Cruz Salinas 

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
**Yes, neither of us have built a PCB

**What you are making?**
**We are making a point marker system so people are less likely to get lost on the trail. The structure will be mounted onto a backpack where we can collect data about people on the trail and video footage. 
We will be implementing a GPS and a camera to detect how many people pass the point marker/ the last time they have been seen.** 

**Inspiration:**
**Inspired by weather balloons** 

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
Sorta something like this: [Design sketch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3_xbuJYvxjo_XcTr9_j6KffJz-hOCN6/view?usp=sharing).
